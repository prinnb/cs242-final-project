Synopsis
My plan for the final project is to create a website for a restaurant that can be easily
maintained. While there are lots of restaurant sites out there, many of them only show
basic information of the restaurant statically, lacking useful features such as making a
reservation and ordering, or are created in a way that is hard for the owners who do
not have skill in web development to edit information and maintain the website.
With my current plan, the restaurant owner would be able to login to the owner mode.
Once logged in, the owner would be able to upload photos and add/edit information
such as location, phone number, food items and prices, etc.
On the other hand, clients would be able to see menu,make a reservation, 
order for takeout/delivery, write suggestion etc. 


Technologies Involved
The project would involve Django, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, HTML, CSS, and database
system. Unlike Assignment3, I would created CSS file myself.
